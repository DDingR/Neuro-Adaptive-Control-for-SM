# Neuro-Adaptive Control for SM

## About this Research

The objective of this research is design neuro-adaptive controller for the synchronized machines.
Main features are as follows:
- Stability analysis in the sense of Lyapunov   
    - With not accurate (estimated) parameters
    - With neural networks
- Constraints handling
    - voltage, current
